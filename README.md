# 🏆 M3 Challenge 2024 --- Housing Shortage & Homelessness

**Team #17927 \| SIAM MathWorks Mathematical Modeling Challenge**

This repository contains our full technical report for the 2024 M3
Challenge, where our team developed mathematical and statistical models
to analyse the relationship between housing supply and homelessness in
UK cities.

## 🔍 Problem Overview

We investigated two tightly coupled crises:

-   Housing supply dynamics\
-   Growth of homelessness populations

Using historical data for **Manchester** and **Brighton & Hove**, we
built predictive models and proposed a policy intervention to mitigate
homelessness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Methodology

Our approach combined time-series modelling and regression analysis:

-   **ARIMA** for long-term housing supply forecasting\
-   **Power and exponential regression** for homelessness trends\
-   **Purchasing-power analysis** (income vs housing price ratio)\
-   **Budget-constrained optimisation model** for policy planning

The models were implemented primarily in **MATLAB** with supporting
analysis in spreadsheets and Python.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Key Results

-   Housing supply is predicted to **increase steadily** in both
    cities.\
-   Manchester homelessness is projected to **grow significantly**
    without intervention.\
-   Brighton & Hove shows a **declining homelessness trend**, likely due
    to effective local policies.\
-   Our intervention model suggests Manchester homelessness could be
    **eliminated by 2028** under stated assumptions.

## 🏗️ Policy Model

We designed a government budget model assuming:

-   terrace housing construction\
-   8 occupants per unit\
-   flood-risk adjustment\
-   annual budget constraints
